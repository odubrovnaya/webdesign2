            <li>Like other bird species, it's the male of the peafowl
              species that has such eye-catching color and lovely
              decorative tail feathers. </li>
            <li>The males don't start to develop color until they are
              about three months old, and it's not until full maturity at
              three years old that their famous display tails are in full
              feather.</li>
            <li>In 1963, the blue or Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) was
              designated India's national bird.</li>
            <li>Peacocks shed their feathers every year after
              mating season, when they can be gathered by those who want
              to keep a collection of the plumage.</li>
            <li>When a peacock fans out his dramatic tail, it isn't just
              appealing and enjoyable to our human eyes. </li>
