        <h1>Apple Galette</h1>
        <p class="txt_ital">
        Apple Galette – A buttery pie-style crust is layered with
        plenty of sweetened fresh apples and then baked until the
        fruit is tender and the crust is beautifully golden brown
        and supremely flakey. It’s one of the absolute best fall
        desserts!
        </p>

        <p><span class="txt_steps">1</span>
            In a food processor, combine the flour with the sugar, salt
            and butter and process for about 5 seconds. Sprinkle the
            ice water over the flour mixture and process until the
            pastry just begins to come together, about 10 seconds; you
            should still be able to see small pieces of butter in it.
            Transfer the pastry to a work surface, gather it together
            and pat into a disk. Wrap the pastry in plastic or wax
            paper and refrigerate until chilled. (You can also roll
            out the pastry and use it right away.)<br><br>
            <span class="txt_steps">2</span>
            Peel, halve and core the apples and slice them
            crosswise 1/4 inch thick. Set aside the larger center
            slices and coarsely chop the end slices and any
            broken ones; about half of the slices should be
            chopped. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and
            cinnamon.<br><br>
            <span class="txt_steps">3</span>
            Preheat the oven to 400°. On a lightly floured work
            surface, roll out the pastry to a 12-by-14-inch
            rectangle and transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet.
            Spread the chopped apples over the pastry to within
            1 inch of the edge. Drizzle the honey over the
            chopped apples. Decoratively arrange the apple
            slices on top in concentric circles or in slightly
            overlapping rows. Sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly
            over the apples and dot with the pieces of butter.
            Fold the pastry edge up and over the apples to create
            a 1-inch border.
