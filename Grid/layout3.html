            <p>Historically, landscape designers trained by apprenticing—such
            as André Le Nôtre, who apprenticed with his father before
            designing the Gardens of Versailles—to accomplished masters in
            the field, with the titular name varying and reputation paramount
            for a career. The professional section of garden designers in
            Europe and the Americas went by the name 'Landscape Gardener.'
            In the 1890s, the distinct classification of landscape architect
            was created, with educational and licensing test requirements for
            using the title legally. Beatrix Farrand, the sole woman in the
            founding group, refused the title preferring Landscape Gardener.
            Matching the client and technical needs of a project, and the
            appropriate practitioner with talent, legal qualifications, and
            experienced skills, surmounts title nomenclature.<br><br>

            Many landscape designers have an interest and involvement with
            gardening, personally or professionally. Gardens are dynamic and
            not static after construction and planting are completed, and so
            in some ways are 'never done.' Involvement with landscape
            management and direction of the ongoing garden direction,
            evolution, and care depend on the professional's and client's
            needs and inclinations. As with the other interrelated landscape
            disciplines, there can be an overlap of services offered under
            the titles of landscape designer or professional gardener</p>
