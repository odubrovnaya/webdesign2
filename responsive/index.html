            <p class="article_p">Not only is the 'Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.' initiative Earth-friendly,
                it's also KidART friendly! There are so many crafts you can make with
                children using recyclables, but today I'd like to focus on the use of
                plastic bottle to create a form of mosaic art.</p>

                <p class="txt_color article_p">There is nothing quite like seeds to signify spring. While our
                    planting days are still far off in the future, we do have some
                    seeds. I found some great crafts and art activities for kids that
                    use seeds so I thought I would share them with you here, just in
                    case you too were needing a reminder of the promise of spring.

                    all ages to do! They’ll love being able to create half a picture to “magically”
                    watch the other half appear!. The kids love it because it’s really cool to see
                    the other side mirror the one that they just painted.</p>
