              Not only is the 'Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.'
              initiative Earth-friendly, it's also KidART friendly! There are so many
              crafts you can make with children using recyclables, but today I'd like
              to focus on the use of plastic bottle to create a form of mosaic art.

                    There is nothing quite like seeds to signify spring. While our
                    planting days are still far off in the future, we do have some seeds.
                    I found some great crafts and art activities for kids that use seeds so
                    I thought I would share them with you here, just in case you too were
                    needing a reminder of the promise of spring.
