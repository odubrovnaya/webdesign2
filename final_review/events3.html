            <p>With its uplifting and positive message, this is a t-shirt that perfectly
                sums up the ADI ethos – that everything is possible when it comes to helping
                animals. ADI exposes and prevents the suffering of animals in entertainment,
                research and other industries through our start-to-finish approach which includes
                evidence from investigations, scientific and legal research and reports,
                awareness and legislative campaigns, and where possible, rescue of animals.

                <p>Bob Barker introduces the video, "To many, it looks like harmless fun,
                    but elephants pay a heavy price for the few minutes of entertainment they
                    provide when performing in circus shows, giving rides, or making appearances
                    at parades, weddings or other events. Most of us marvel at the majesty of
                    wild animals and I can understand why people want to see animals like
                    elephants up close. But isn´t it especially tragic when animals are
                    suffering and being abused simply to entertain us?"

                <p>Lion Ark is a vivid behind the scenes account of probably the most ambitious
                    animal rescue ever undertaken, the finale of which sees 25 lions rescued from
                    illegal traveling circuses across Bolivia being flown to safety in the USA. A shocking
                    undercover investigation leads to a ban on animal circuses in Bolivia. But the
                    circuses defy the law. The team behind the investigation return, track down the
                    illegal circuses and save every animal. We follow the confrontations, heartache
                    and risks the team face, before an emotional finale sees 25 lions airlifted 5,000
                    miles to freedom in Colorado.

                    On December 8, just two weeks after relocating the first three tigers from
                    Guatemala, ADI co-founders Jan Creamer (pictured above) and Tim Phillips shared
                    updates, videos, and the inside story from the rescue mission in Guatemala and
                    from the ADI Wildlife Sanctuary in South Africa to an intimate audience at El
                    Cid restaurant in Los Angeles. In addition to film shows, the relaxed and fun
                    event included vegan hors d´oeuvres, special animal-themed cocktails, holiday
                    gifts for sale, and an auction of art work featuring some of ADI’s rescued
                    animals. Proceeds from the event helped fund the huge airlift of the remaining
                    17 lions and tigers from Guatemala to South Africa.

                    On October 12, in Hollywood, ADI founders Jan Creamer and Tim Phillips gave an
                    illustrated talk about the emotions, compassion, altruism, and intelligence of
                    animals they have witnessed during ADI´s work. They joined a diverse panel at
                    a special event, `Sacred Stories of Animals, Faith and Compassion,´ hosted by
                    The Guibord Center and the Vedanta Society of Southern California.

                <p>On Tuesday, May 21, ADI was in Washington, DC, with Representatives Raúl
                    Grijalva (D-AZ) and David Schweikert (R-AZ) to reintroduce the Traveling Exotic
                    Animal and Public Safety Protection Act (TEAPSPA; HR2863). The bill seeks to
                    amend the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the use of exotic and wild animals in
                    traveling performances.

                <p>ADI’s summer Garden Party on July 22, 2018 was a huge success, with guests
                    enjoying delicious vegan wines and food in good company. For the second year
                    running, the event was hosted by ADI supporters Lo Sprague and Gwynne Guibord
                    in their beautiful Hancock Park garden. ADI founders Jan and Tim updated guests
                    on Operation Liberty in Guatemala and the building of a new ADI Wildlife
                    Sanctuary in South Africa, and bidding on a unique auction featuring one of
                    ADI´s famous green watering cans - `enjoyed´ by Kimba, one of five ex-circus
