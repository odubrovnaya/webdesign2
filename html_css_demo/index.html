       <div class="biography"><p>
           David Hockney is an English painter, draftsman, printmaker, stage designer,
           and photographer. As an important contributor to the pop art movement of the
           1960s, he is considered one of the most influential British artists of the
           20th century.</br></br>
           <img src="images/portrait.jpg" alt="post_img" class="portrait" />
           Born in Bradford in 1937, Hockney was one of the big artists involved in the
           pop art movement in the 1960s. Pop art was a style of art that was bright, full
           of colour. It was made by lots of young artists who felt that the art they saw in
           galleries was a little bit boring. To find out more about pop art, watch our handy
           video. It’s likely that you’ll learn about pop art in school and then you can
           mention Hockney and impress all your friends and teachers.</br></br>
           Hockney lives in London, but owns two other homes in California. You can imagine
           then that a lot of his work varies, because California and the UK are very different
           places. California is usually always sunny, where as in England the weather changes
           all the time. So, when painting in England, Hockney likes to paint the seasons.
           In Going Up Garrowby Hill, Hockney has painted a canvas of the landscape in
           Yorkshire, where he was brought up. There are lots of different colours.
